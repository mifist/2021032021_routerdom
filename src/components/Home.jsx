      <h2>Learn based on real market needs</h2>
      <p>
        In IT, experience is everything. Employers want developers capable of
        taking on projects and solving problems, things that only real
        experience can teach you. That’s why the 100+ hours in class are heavily
        practical. Together with a senior practitioner, our groups become teams
        who work on real projects, just like in a company. Theory is studied
        independently via our web portal.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this to work, our close ties with Beetroot are key. They
        continuously provide us with their recent projects, so that the skills
        you learn are top-modern and hot on the market.

        We grew out of Beetroot, a successful IT company from Sweden. But unlike
        Beetroot, we have no commercial goals. We aim to maximize social impact
        instead of profit. We want individuals to develop and start new careers,
        and we want their communities to develop with them. In order to keep our
        focus on this mission, we have decided to operate as a non-profit. Money
        is never paid out to owners or investors. Instead, we reinvest that
        money to improve our courses and teaching conditions.
